# Udacity-ABtest-final-project

## Prompt

### Experiment Overview

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.

In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.

The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.

The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.

## Recommendation

My recommendation is to not launch the test since the actual underlying goal we had was not reached (increase fraction of paying users by asking them in advance if they have the time to invest in the course), we can only recommend to not continue with change. It may have caused a change in Gross conversion, but it didn't for net conversion.

The difference for the gross conversion is practically significant and negative. This is a good sign: the Udacity team can lower costs by a number of trial signups.
The difference for the net conversion is not statistically significant. It means the absence of serious financial losses.
Negative results of the experiment:

- The interval for the difference in the case of the net conversion includes negative numbers. Therefore, the team has a risk to decrease incomes.
- We have not gathered enough data to draw conclusions about the retention and because of this we can not evaluate correctly the difference between the control and experimental groups for a number of students who were disappointed in studying during the free period. Consequently, we do not know enrolled users would be disappointed in the learning process less and make more payments or would not.

## Adjustment to the test

I would suggest these possible changes to the proposed experiment.

- Extend the duration of the experiment up to 2 months with constant monitoring of incomes for avoiding financial risks. If the decline in revenues becomes out of the certain limits, the study should be stopped immediately.
- Measure all three evaluation metrics (the gross conversion, the retention, and the net conversion) for the 100% level of traffic because the audience of this site is very different in education, age, nationality, and other characteristics. Any reduction in the percentage of participants can significantly distort the results.
- Replace the visualization message by the video with an explanation of successful learning strategies based on statistics of the particular site or by the input test for the course level recommendations exactly for this user.
- In order to avoid the negative psychological effect or cut the extremely talented part of the audience which is able to pass the course without spending a lot of time to study, all changes should be only informative and recommendatory.
- Recommendations in the videos or leveled tests should have the most practical character that is suitable for this course.
